Tic-Tac-Toe

Overview
    Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. This application allows two players to enter their names, play the game, and keep track of the game history.

Features
    Two-player Mode: Allows two players to enter their names and alternate turns.
    Game History: The game keeps a history of past games and displays them in a list.
    Local Storage: The game history is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.
    Clear History: Allows users to clear the game history.
    Responsive UI: The game adapts to different screen sizes and provides an intuitive interface.

How to Play
    Enter Player 1 and Player 2 names in the input fields.
    Click "Start Game" to begin.
    Players alternate turns clicking on the grid cells. Player 1 will play as "X" and Player 2 as "O".
    The game announces the winner once a player gets three marks in a row or declares a draw if no more moves are available.
    After the game, the result is stored in the history, and players can choose to view the history or start a new game.
